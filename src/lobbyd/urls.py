"""Canonical service URLs (room-o-matic/docs#5).

A service endpoint is compared and stored only in canonical form, so equivalent spellings
of one URL can't be registered as different endpoints, and unsafe forms are rejected
before any credential is minted for them. Copied into the client
(roomomatic/urls.py); keep the copies in sync.

Rules: http or https only; lowercase host; default port dropped; no userinfo, query,
fragment, percent-encoding, backslashes, empty segments or dot segments; no trailing
slash. Private and loopback hosts stay allowed for single-operator development.
